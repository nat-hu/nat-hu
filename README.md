### About Me

> *"Imagination is the Discovering Faculty, pre-eminently. It is that which penetrates into the unseen worlds around us, the worlds of science."* — **Ada Lovelace**

I’m a 25-year-old **Digital Sciences Master’s student** at TH Köln. I live for technical challenges—whether it’s mastering a new programming language, diving into the latest LLM research, or building data-driven solutions in a team. 

While I’m currently deep in the world of **AI, NLP, and Machine Learning** (mostly with Python), my roots are in **Java Software Development and Fullstack Web Development**. 
I love learning new things and pushing my limits like last year, when I moved to Paris for an exchange at **Epitech**, learning **C from scratch** through their intensive "Active Pedagogy" (The Pool).

### 🔬 Featured Research
* **CLEF 2024 Publication:** Engineered an ensemble approach (GPT-4, Llama 3, Gemma) for Multilingual Hallucination Detection (**0.91 F1-score**). [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2407.09152-b31b1b?style=flat-square&logo=arxiv&logoColor=white">](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09152)
* **Master's Thesis:** Few-shot LLM forecasting and time series anomaly detection using **Mistral & LLaMA & DeepSeek** via the **Unsloth Framework**.

### ⚡ Technical Toolkit
**AI/Data:** Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face, Unsloth, SQL, Snowflake, Celonis, Dataiku  
**Engineering:** C, C++, Java, Linux, Docker, Git  
**Languages:** German (Native), English (C1), French (A2)

### 🔒 Note on Repositories
Most of my work is kept in **private repositories** for confidentiality and academic integrity.
However, you can find a selection of projects here that reflect my journey and growth, starting from my roots in Media Informatics and evolving into my current specialization in Data Science. 
These public repositories showcase a variety of lab work and personal experiments across different languages and frameworks.
